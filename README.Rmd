# Winter A&E performance

The goal of ae_performance is to produce analysis of A&E winter performance. Data is sourced from [A&E Attendances and Emergency Admissions 2023-24](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times-and-activity/ae-attendances-and-emergency-admissions-2023-24/).

Here we are defining the winter period as Nov to Feb inclusive.

## How to run

To run the code source `main.R` file in the base directory.

## Data used

All data used is public and so lookups have been committed alongside code.
